# CHAPTER 7: Input and Output

## 7.1 Standard Input and Output

#### Exercise 7-1

Write a program that converts upper case to lower or lower case to upper, depending on the name it is invoked with, as found in `argv[0]`.

## 7.2 Formatted Output—Printf

#### Exercise 7-2

Write a program that will print arbitrary input in a sensible way. As a minimum, it should print non-graphic characters in octal or hexadecimal according to local custom, and break long text lines.

## 7.3 Variable-length Argument Lists

#### Exercise 7-3

Revise `minprintf` to handle more of the other facilities of `printf`.

## 7.4 Formatted Input—Scanf

#### Exercise 7-4

Write a private version of `scanf` analogous to `minprintf` from the previous section.

#### Exercise 7-5

Rewrite the postfix calculator of Chapter 4 to use `scanf` and/or `sscanf` to do the input and number conversion.

## 7.5 File Access

## 7.6 Error Handling—Stderr and Exit

## 7.7 Line Input and Output

#### Exercise 7-6

Write a program to compare two files, printing the first line where they differ.

#### Exercise 7-7

Modify the pattern finding program of Chapter 5 to take its input from a set of named files or, if no files are named as arguments, from the standard input. Should the file name be printed when a matching line is found?

#### Exercise 7-8

Write a program to print a set of files, starting each new one on a new page, with a title and a running page count for each file.
