# CHAPTER 3: Control Flow

## 3.1 Statements and Blocks

## 3.2 If-Else

## 3.3 Else-If

#### Exercise 3-1

Our binary search makes two tests inside the loop, when one would suffice (at the price of more tests outside). Write a version with only one test inside the loop and measure the difference in run-time.

## 3.4 Switch

#### Exercise 3-2

Write a function `escape(s,t)` that converts characters like newline and tab into visible escape sequences like `\n` and `\t` as it copies the string `t` to `s`. Use a `switch`. Write a function for the other direction as well, converting escape sequences into the real characters.
