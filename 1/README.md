# CHAPTER 1: A Tutorial Introduction

## 1.1 Getting Started

#### Exercise 1-1

Run the “`hello, world`” program on your system. Experiment with leaving out parts of the program, to see what error messages you get.

#### Exercise 1-2

Experiment to find out what happens when `printf`’s argument string contains `\c`, where c is some character not listed above.

## 1.2 Variables and Arithmetic Expressions

#### Exercise 1-3

Modify the temperature conversion program to print a heading above the table.

#### Exercise 1-4

Write a program to print the corresponding Celsius to Fahrenheit table.

### 1.3 The For Statement

#### Exercise 1-5

Modify the temperature conversion program to print the table in reverse order, that is, from 300 degrees to 0.

## 1.5 Character Input and Output

### 1.5.1 File Copying

#### Exercise 1-6

Verify that the expression `getchar() != EOF` is 0 or 1.

#### Exercise 1-7

Write a program to print the value of `EOF`.

### 1.5.2 Character Counting

### 1.5.3 Line Counting

#### Exercise 1-8

Write a program to count blanks, tabs, and newlines.

#### Exercise 1-9

Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each string of one or more blanks by a single blank.

#### Exercise 1-10

Write a program to copy its input to its output, replacing each tab by `\t`, each backspace by `\b`, and each backslash by `\\`. This makes tabs and backspaces visible in an unambiguous way.

### 1.5.4 Word Counting

#### Exercise 1-11

How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

#### Exercise 1-12

Write a program that prints its input one word per line.

## 1.6 Arrays

#### Exercise 1-13

Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words in its input. It is easy to draw the histogram with the bars horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging.

#### Exercise 1-14

Write a program to print a histogram of the frequencies of different characters in its input.
