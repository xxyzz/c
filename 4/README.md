# CHAPTER 4: Functions and Program Structure

## 4.1 Basics of Functions

#### Exercise 4-1

Write the function `strrindex(s,t)`, which returns the position of the rightmost occurrence of `t` in `s`, or `−1` if there is none.

## 4.2 Functions Returning Non-integers

#### Exercise 4-2

Extend `atof` to handle scientific notation of the form `123.45e−6` where a floating-point number may be followed by `e` or `E` and an optionally signed exponent.

## 4.3 External Variables

#### Exercise 4-3

Given the basic framework, it’s straightforward to extend the calculator. Add the modulus (`%`) operator and provisions for negative numbers.
