# CHAPTER 2: Types, Operators, and Expressions

## 2.1 Variable Names

## 2.2 Data Types and Sizes

#### Exercise 2-1

Write a program to determine the ranges of `char`, `short`, `int`, and `long` variables, both `signed` and `unsigned`, by printing appropriate values from standard headers and by direct computation. Harder if you compute them: determine the ranges of the various floating-point types.

## 2.3 Constants

## 2.4 Declarations

## 2.5 Arithmetic Operators

## 2.6 Relational and Logical Operators

#### Exercise 2-2

Write a loop equivalent to the `for` loop above without using `&&` or `||`.

## 2.7 Type Conversions

#### Exercise 2-3

Write the function `htoi(s)`, which converts a string of hexadecimal digits (including an optional `0x` or `0X`) into its equivalent integer value. The allowable digits are `0` through `9`, `a` through `f`, and `A` through `F`.
