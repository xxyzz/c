# CHAPTER 2: Types, Operators, and Expressions

## 2.1 Variable Names

## 2.2 Data Types and Sizes

#### Exercise 2-1

Write a program to determine the ranges of `char`, `short`, `int`, and `long` variables, both `signed` and `unsigned`, by printing appropriate values from standard headers and by direct computation. Harder if you compute them: determine the ranges of the various floating-point types.

## 2.3 Constants

## 2.4 Declarations

## 2.5 Arithmetic Operators

## 2.6 Relational and Logical Operators

#### Exercise 2-2

Write a loop equivalent to the `for` loop above without using `&&` or `||`.

## 2.7 Type Conversions

#### Exercise 2-3

Write the function `htoi(s)`, which converts a string of hexadecimal digits (including an optional `0x` or `0X`) into its equivalent integer value. The allowable digits are `0` through `9`, `a` through `f`, and `A` through `F`.

## 2.8 Increment and Decrement Operators

#### Exercise 2-4

Write an alternate version of `squeeze(s1,s2)` that deletes each character in `s1` that matches any character in the string `s2`.

#### Exercise 2-5

Write the function `any(s1,s2)`, which returns the first location in the string `s1` where any character from the string `s2` occurs, or `âˆ’1` if `s1` contains no characters from `s2`. (The standard library function `strpbrk` does the same job but returns a pointer to the location.)

## 2.9 Bitwise Operators

#### Exercise 2-6

Write a function `setbits(x,p,n,y)` that returns `x` with the `n` bits that begin at position `p` set to the rightmost `n` bits of `y`, leaving the other bits unchanged.

#### Exercise 2-7

Write a function `invert(x,p,n)` that returns `x` with the `n` bits that begin at position `p` inverted (i.e., 1 changed into 0 and vice versa), leaving the others unchanged.

#### Exercise 2-8

Write a function `rightrot(x,n)` that returns the value of the integer `x` rotated to the right by `n` bit positions.
